# Hi! I'm Nobel from Indonesia.

I'm a first year undergraduate at Oxford University reading computer science.

Professionally, I'm a full-stack app developer, competitive programmer, and an aspiring AI & Quantum Computing researcher. My stack includes React Native, Web3, Python, C++, Go, and more.

I'm currently working on Zacch, a bill-splitting app that used graph theory and OCR to make bill splitting easy.

Reach out for projects!
